# Rules
## Participation
1. You are only allowed to submit one ticket per game giveaway. Any additional submissions will not count.
2. Accounts must be at least 3 months old to be eligible for a ticket submission. Any accounts younger than 3 months will not have their submission counted.
3. Any harrassment of others, or other means of communication that seek to discourage others from participation will be met with an immediate ban, and a manual removal from the list of participants.
4. At any point, and for any reason, the giveaway may be cancelled or postponed by either the streamer or the moderators.
5. At any point, and for any reason, participants may withdraw their name from the pool if they desire.

## Redemption
1. You'll be contacted via whispers by Feutch or moderators if inactive in chat at the time (any contact not from Feutch or mods is not legitimate and should be considered fraudulent). If unable to respond by the next stream time - the redemption will be considered ignored and a redraw will occur.
2. To recieve your code you must message confirming you would like to recieve it & provide a valid discord account id in order to be direct messaged the code securely. To find your Discord User ID [this video with instructions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SNxNNpiRR1M).
3. To provide an account you must direct message Feutch or a moderator via Twitch. **The direct message must be from the same account that won the giveaway** and must be via Twitch messaging (this is to prevent fraudulent claims for codes). 
4. Discord accounts provided **must be unique to each redemption**. This means that if two different Twitch accounts win a giveaway and the same discord account is provided for redemption the second giveaway winner will be disqualified. However, if a single Twitch account wins more than once the same discord account can be provided. 
5. If you no longer wish to accept your code, please indicate so and the code will be kept for a redraw if deemed appropriate. **As soon as a code is MESSAGED this counts as an accepted redemption** (this is because we cannot verify whether the code has been used or not and do not want to risk giving away bad codes). 

# Details
Giveaways are ran by a custom giveaway flow created using [streamer.bot](https://streamer.bot/). The process is entirely random and is determined by selecting a random line of text from a document of submitted usernames. 
**Subscriptions, donations and bit redemptions DO NOT increase the odds of winning in any way** as every user is only allowed one entry into the document. 

For more details on the underlying function that determines the winning user see [the file reading documentation on streamer.bot](https://docs.streamer.bot/api/sub-actions/core/file-io/read-random-line-from-file)

All game keys are Steam Keys meaning they will only work if redeemed via the Steam Store on a valid account. For instructions on redeeming steam keys see: [Activating a Product on Steam](https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/2A12-9D79-C3D7-F870).

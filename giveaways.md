# Rules
1. You are only allowed to submit one ticket per game giveaway. Any additional submissions will not count.
2. Accounts must be at least 3 months old to be eligible for a ticket submission. Any accounts younger than 3 months will not have their submission counted.
3. Any harrassment of others, or other means of communication that seek to discourage others from participation will be met with an immediate ban, and a manual removal from the list of participants.
4. At any point, and for any reason, the giveaway may be cancelled or postponed by either the streamer or the moderators.
5. At any point, and for any reason, participants may withdraw their name from the pool if they desire. 

# Details
Giveaways are ran by a custom giveaway flow created by me using [streamer.bot](https://streamer.bot/). The process is entirely random and is determined by selecting a random line of text from a document of submitted usernames. 
**Subscriptions, donations and bit redemptions DO NOT increase the odds of winning in any way** as every user is only allowed one entry into the document. 

For more details on the underlying function that determines the winning user see [the file reading documentation on streamer.bot](https://docs.streamer.bot/api/sub-actions/core/file-io/read-random-line-from-file)

# Legal
Giveaways are organised following instruction outlined in the [South Australian Fundraising and Sweepstakes Details](https://www.sa.gov.au/topics/family-and-community/community-organisations/fundraising-for-organisations/sweepstakes).
